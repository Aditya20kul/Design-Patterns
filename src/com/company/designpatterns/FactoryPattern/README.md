The factory method is a creational design pattern, i.e., related to object creation. In the Factory pattern, we create objects without exposing the creation logic to the client and the client uses the same common interface to create a new type of object.

The idea is to use a static member-function (static factory method) that creates & returns instances, hiding the details of class modules from the user.
A factory pattern is one of the core design principles to create an object, allowing clients to create objects of a library(explained below) in a way such that it doesnâ€™t have a tight coupling with the class hierarchy of the library.
